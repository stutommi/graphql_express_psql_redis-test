This is a simple GQL server that works for me as a learning project for these things:

- Implementing Redis as a cache
- Containerizing whole project with docker
- Handling basics of PSQL with sequelize


How to run it:

0. Have docker installed! (https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
1. git clone this repo
2. cd inside the repo directory
3. run command "docker-compose up"
4. test that is works at http://localhost:3000/graphql
